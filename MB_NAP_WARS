sudo apt-get install libqtgui4:i386 (then copy to MB steams folder)

So, every time I've tried to start configuration instead of game - I had nothing. Problem was:

Cannot mix incompatible Qt library (version 0x40806) with this library (version 0x40801)
Aborted (core dumped)

What have I done...
Open the terminal, write:

$ locate libQtCore

then, you should have something like that:

/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libQtCore.so.4
/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libQtCore.so.4.8
/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libQtCore.so.4.8.6

All you need is libQtCore.so.4 and libQtGui.so.4 (they are in same folder).
Run this command:

$ rm "$HOME/.steam/SteamApps/common/MountBlade Warband/libQtCore.so.4" && rm "$HOME/.steam/SteamApps/common/MountBlade Warband/libQtGui.so.4" && cp /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libQtCore.so.4 "$HOME/.steam/SteamApps/common/MountBlade Warband" && cp /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libQtGui.so.4 "$HOME/.steam/SteamApps/common/MountBlade Warband"

After that, everything should be working. :)

(To dev's. Can you make some kind of detection of this libs and use them instead of yours? Thanks in advance for answer)
